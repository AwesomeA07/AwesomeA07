#Hi, I’m @AwesomeA07<br>
__I’m interested in:__<br>
goofing around. and making a website, something in python and a minecraft mod. also figuring out how github works.<br>
<br>
<br>

Python. am an absolute beginner.<br>
<br>
<br>
__I’m looking to collaborate on:__<br>
Nothing. Because I'm trash at coding, I have no real motivation to try and start making stuff (I probably will in the future) and whatever I'm gonna do is either as a hobby or when I do a side hustle.<br>
